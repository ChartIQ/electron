# Electron Source Code

The [Electron Blog](https://electronjs.org/blog) is also an extremely helpful resource. Some posts are below:

* [Message Loop Integration](https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-internals-node-integration)
* [Using Node as a library](https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-internals-using-node-as-a-library)
* [Weak References](https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-internals-weak-references)
* [Building Chromium as a Library](https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-internals-building-chromium-as-a-library)

The [Electron API docs](https://electronjs.org/docs/api) are also helpful. The APIs below are similar to Chromium Content APIs, and helpful to understand.

* [BrowserWindow](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window)
* [WebContents](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/web-contents)
* [WebFrame](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/web-frame).
