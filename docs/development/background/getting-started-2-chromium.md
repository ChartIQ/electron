# Getting familiar with Chromium:

A lot of developing with Electron comes down to working with Chromium.

## How Blink Works

* Read [How Blink Works](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aitSOucL0VHZa9Z2vbRJSyAIsAz24kX8LFByQ5xQnUg/edit)
* Draw a diagram from the section: Page, Frame, Document, DOMWindow etc. The diagram should have the relationship between each of these objects. Include threading if you can.

## How Chromium Displays Web Pages

* Read how [Chromium displays web pages](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/displaying-a-web-page-in-chrome)
* Draw a diagram of how all of the pieces connect (browser process, renderer, page, frame, window, document).

## Chromium Multi-process architecture

* Read [Multi-process architecture](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/multi-process-architecture)
* Draw the diagrams provided. Make sure you can label all the objects in the diagram (RenderProcessHost, RenderViewHost, RenderProcess, RenderView, etc.), and understand how the system fits together.

## Chromium Site Isolation

* Read [Site Isolation Design document](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/site-isolation)
